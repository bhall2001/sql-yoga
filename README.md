SQL Yoga database library for LiveCode

This repository hosts the source code for the SQL Yoga library for LiveCode. While the library can be used independently of any framework, SQL Yoga is distributed as a Helper for the [Levure framework](https://www.github.com/trevordevore/levure). The documentation is written from that perspective.

For an example of a Levure application that uses SQL Yoga check out the [sql-yoga-levure repository](https://github.com/trevordevore/sql-yoga-levure-app).

The documentation can be found in the [repo wiki](https://github.com/trevordevore/sql-yoga/wiki). That is where you will find instructions on getting started.
