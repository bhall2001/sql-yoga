SQL Yoga database library for LiveCode

This repository hosts the source code for the SQL Yoga library for LiveCode. SQL Yoga allows you to treat your database like an object in LiveCode. Some of the features include:

- Set properties on objects rather than writing SQL.
- Define searches using english words rather than arcane wildcard symbols.
- Manipulate arrays, not cursors.
- Easily generate searches from complex search UIs.
- Leverage SQL Yoga's knowledge of database table relationships to simplify code.

While the library can be used independently of any framework, SQL Yoga is distributed as a Helper for the [Levure framework](https://www.github.com/trevordevore/levure). The documentation is written from that perspective.

For an example of a Levure application that uses SQL Yoga check out the [sql-yoga-levure repository](https://github.com/trevordevore/sql-yoga-levure-app).

The documentation can be found in the [repo wiki](https://github.com/trevordevore/sql-yoga/wiki). That is where you will find instructions on getting started.
