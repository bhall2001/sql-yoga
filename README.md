SQL Yoga database library for LiveCode

SQL Yoga is a database library for LiveCode built on top of RevDB or Valentina. Using the database schema and information from you, the developer, SQL Yoga allows you to write less code when querying and updating an application's database.

While the library can be used independently of any framework, SQL Yoga is distributed as a Helper for the [Levure framework](https://www.github.com/trevordevore/levure). Levure makes using SQL Yoga much easier from a configuration and customization perspective.

The SQL Yoga documentation can be found in the [repo wiki](https://github.com/trevordevore/sql-yoga/wiki). That is where you will find instructions on getting started.

SQL Yoga works with LiveCode 8 or newer.
